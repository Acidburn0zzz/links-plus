Use tls_error() to get error messages instead of generic SSL_ERROR in popup

What is cache ssl_info?

When to free tls - print out tls_free call, make sure called after connection, on kill connection, and on exit?
When to free tls_config
replace/change ssl_finish

When to abort_connection instead of retry?  I think tls masks the way this was handled with SSL
Remove log_ssl_error, or replace with tls error

x add port_str in url.c? (not needed, but should have used sprintf like ftp.c)
