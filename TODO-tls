For 2.10:
  In sched.c where tls pointer is copied, copy config also?
  Use ssl_finish in https.c?

Enable/disable cookies doesn't take immediate effect

Make configure find, include libtls

SSL verification over SOCKS (check proxies, too).

Unbreak NSS - remove it.  No good disabling TLS with libtls.

Use tls_error() to get error messages instead of generic SSL_ERROR in popup

What is cache ssl_info?

Does tls close and free everything under all close situations?  End of transfer, kill all connections, kill all background connections, other?

Replace/change ssl_finish?

When to abort_connection instead of retry?  I think tls masks the way this was handled with SSL
Remove log_ssl_error, or replace with tls error
